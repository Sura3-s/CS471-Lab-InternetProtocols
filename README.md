# CS471-Lab-InternetProtocols
---
This repository contains my work for **CS471 (Web Technologies) â€“ Lab Week 2**.  
In this lab, I used **Wireshark** to capture and analyze different internet protocols including **HTTP, TCP, and UDP**.  

---
## Lab Activities
1. **Capturing HTTP Traffic** :
    - Captured HTTP packets while visiting [https://qu.edu.sa](https://qu.edu.sa).  
   - Analyzed requests and responses (methods, status codes).  

3. **Analyzing TCP/IP Traffic** :
   - Observed TCP packets.  
   - Identified the three-way handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK).  
   - Noted sequence/acknowledgment numbers and connection termination.  

4. **Capturing UDP Traffic** :
   - Generated UDP traffic (e.g., streaming).  
   - Analyzed UDP headers (source/destination ports, length, data).  

5. **Comparing TCP and UDP** :
   - Filled tables with reliability, ordering, use cases, and performance differences.

## Conclusion
Through this lab, I learned how to use Wireshark to monitor, capture, and analyze internet protocols. I was able to see the difference between **TCP and UDP**, their reliability, and their practical use cases.
